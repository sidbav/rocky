# Rocky

Rocky is a slack mircoservice AKA a slack bot! Currently Rocky can:
- say hello ('Hey Rocky! How are you?')
- tell you the time and weather at a given location ('Rocky, What is the time in Vancouver right now?')
- the time difference between two locations ('Rocky how many hours ahead is New Zealand than Toronto?') 
- respond to you saying thanks ('Thanks for the help @Rocky.')
- say goodbye ('Bye Rocky!')
